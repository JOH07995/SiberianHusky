    <p>Huskies are a great companion that are some of the most dramatic and funny dogs on the planet</p>
    
    <h1>Loyal</h1>
    <p>As born pack dogs, Siberians enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs; they are bred to pull hard in harness with other dogs. Your Husky will be your willing helpmate for life.
    </p>

    <h1>Mischievous</h1>
    <p>Because Huskies are smart and curious, they often get into things they shouldnâ€™t be getting into!
    </p>

    <h1>Outgoing</h1>
    <p>Huskies are open to meeting with people and other dogs; they are keen to explore and find things out, and need lots of stimulation and adventure.</p>
